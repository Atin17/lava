        RFZero
        Resonate and fire neuron with spike trigger of threshold and
        0-phase crossing. Graded spikes carry amplitude of oscillation.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : tuple(int)
            Number and topology of RF neurons.
        freqs : numpy.ndarray
            Frequency for each neuron (Hz).
        decay_tau : numpy.ndarray
            Decay time constant (s).
        dt : float, optional
            Time per timestep. Default is 0.001 seconds.
        vth : float, optional
            Neuron threshold voltage.
            Currently, only a single threshold can be set for the entire
            population of neurons.
